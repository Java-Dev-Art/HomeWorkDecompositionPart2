> # Task 1

Solve the tasks:
1. Write a method(s) that checks whether the given three numbers are coprime.
2. Implement the addition of two numbers of unlimited length. Use the String type to store numbers. To solve the problem, use the division of code into methods.
3. Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. Find all Armstrong numbers from 1 to k. To solve the problem, use the division of code into methods. To solve the problem, use the division of code into methods.
4. An array D is given. Determine the following sums: **D[l] + D[2] + D[3]; D[3] + D[4] + D[5]; D[4] +D[5] +D[6]**.
   Explanation. Compose a method(s) for calculating the sum of three consecutive array elements with numbers from k to m.
5. «Super Lock». The secret lock for the safe consists of 10 cells arranged in a row, into which you need to insert dice. But the door opens only if in any three neighboring cells the sum of points on the front faces of the dice is 10. (A dice has from 1 to 6 points on each face). Write a program that solves the code of the lock, provided that two dice are already inserted into the cells. To solve the problem, use the division of code into methods.
  
> ### Task Solving Memo:
  1. Read the task condition several times.
  2. Create an algorithm for solving a problem with several data sets (for example, integers and real numbers, sets with negative numbers, etc.).
  3. Pay attention to the maximum allowable values.
  4. Try to simplify the algorithm (if possible and understand how to do it)Simplify the algorithm (you can use pseudocode).
  5. Write code in Java. Use comments.
  6. Test the code using several input data sets in accordance with paragraph 2 and make sure that the written code is working properly.
  7. The task is considered solved if the year was completed successfully in accordance with the condition and the output parameters correspond to the input parameters.
